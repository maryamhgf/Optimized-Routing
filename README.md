# Optimized-Routing
Implementation of optimized routing between two points of a region.
In district 14 of Tehran, we defined 21 points of the map as important origins or destinations. These points and some other information about them(like latitude, longitude, neighbor points(that there is possible rout to them), and neighbor weights (according to reaching time) are in information.csv file.
So after running the program, you can see all these 21 points and type your origin and destination. The best route will be shown in the red line. We also have considered one-way streets.


(The map was downloaded from Google Maps.)
