# Optimized-Routing
Implementation of optimized routing between two points of a region.
In district 14 of Tehran, we defined 21 points of the map as important origins or destinations.
So after running the program, you can see all these 21 points and type your origin and destination. The best route will be shown in the red line. We also have considered one-way streets.

(The map was downloaded from Google Maps.)
